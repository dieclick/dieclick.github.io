ʄ.

I wish I could talk to you. I wish I knew how to start this message. I even wish I knew whether you read me. I can’t feel anything other than wanting to talk to you—only you. No one else. I don’t want anyone else to read this except you… I want to believe you would respect that…

When I saw you… I can’t get your expression out of my mind. Your face. I feel… sadness. I see how you look away if you happen to notice me. I feel uncomfortable too. My body trembles when I realize it’s you. My hands shake, my throat goes dry. And I can feel a literal wall between us.

I wish I weren’t weak. I used all my will and courage, but all I could say was hello. I wish I had been able to ask you about your day… I’m happy to see you. I get happy when I see you. But a deep pain stabs my stomach when I see your expression avoiding eye contact. When you lower your head so you don’t look. I didn’t want that.

I wish I had been stronger, just to talk to you. I see how you turn away, how you hide, how you avoid us… that makes me sad. Because I… I care about you… I want to talk to you. I want to ask how things are over there, how you feel, how you’re doing.

Deep inside, I know that when that face of loneliness, fear, and avoidance appears in front of me… I only see you. A ʄ. A small, bright, and vulnerable ʄ.

I want to extend my hand, break that barrier and that wall, just to… caress her… caress you.

I remember those nights in the car, when you told me about your past, when that small version of you appeared. When you cried in front of me, showing your deepest fear. I remember you pushed me away… but I didn’t leave. I stayed… you mattered to me. I didn’t want you to cry… I wanted to comfort you… I still want to comfort you.

To take care of you, to hold your tearful head against my chest and hug you tightly. To dissipate the enormous pressure that wall has created. I still want to, because I know you. I was a confidant, I was someone you trusted—I miss that.

I remember when we kissed subtly behind a stand, or when you softly kissed my cheek that night when you got out of my car. The gentle feeling of caring for a wounded girl. Stroking your hair. Hugging you deeply and feeling the warmth of your skin.

I know we exchanged many letters. I reread some… I regret what I wrote. I was… harsh. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I would never want to hurt you. I would never want to see you with that sad face. Overwhelmed when you see me…

I wanted to get closer. I know you unblocked me… it makes me wonder if I crossed your mind then… I only deeply wish to talk to you again… if you ever come… please tell me… and I will wait for you… I will open my arms… and wait for you to hug me tightly… and cry into me… so I can hold you… comfort you… see your face…

The face that meant so much to me.

I don’t know where life has taken you.
Part of me wonders what you would say, but honestly, I don’t expect a response.

On Discord, you once became the place where I stored my feelings every day… without expecting your reply… it’s curious.

I just wanted to share what I felt, quietly and sincerely.
I truly hope life is treating you kindly… and with the gentleness you deserve.
The time we spent together meant something to me… and you made me happy.
