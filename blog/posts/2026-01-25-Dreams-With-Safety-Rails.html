<h1>Dreams with safety rails</h1>

<p>The good thing about dreams is that they end.</p>

<p>Ever so often I get this dream in which I unlock the Freeform.</p>

<p>In not too sure if I get it regularly, or if I’m completely conscious that I’m dreaming, but it comes with perks.</p>

<p>Telekinesis, time warping, and body swapping.</p>

<p>It is common to cause mayhem in some part if I get bored. Maybe slowly pull apart and take down all the cd stands in mixup, maybe cause chaos in a center market I know it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>And when authorities begin tracking me I just pull up a granny press two fingers to her head and I swap bodies with her, such I run free.</p>

<p>But this one was curious because she knew what I was doing, as in the transaction I realised she could do the same thing I do. Another agent in the dream dimension. Which begs me the question if she is awaken already. I wonder where she sleeps, I wonder if I could ever met her.</p>

<p>Over time, the dream dimension has been building and concentrating into this megalopolis of settings and places. In which I know for a fact I have seen conscious and unconscious.</p>

<p>For once an hotel stands apart, a fancy hotel with three subterranean parkings, walking inside it welcomes a ring structure, there is an elevator in the inner ring which connects to the rest of the floors, the red carpet and golden lights ambient a place with activity but ordered tranquility.</p>

<p>I was once kicked out of there because I had rags and the staff thought I was a hobo.</p>

<p>Next the hotel comes the megaplex of a fuselage of buildings, a fancy mall is intertwined into several floors, given that one of the floors uppermost is the rotten decaying market with dimly blue lighted stands of clothes, veils, and everything the common class could need, separated across with metal sheets that are rarely often closed, giving this maze like place a disorienting feeling of being the only one lost in a place where the few people around you do know where they are.</p>

<p>Across the mall we can reach a multilevel center of electric stairs which in conjunction of snail like slopes we can see the profound feeling hole that connects the many levels into the other buildings.</p>

<p>One of which is a university. I’m not very liked there either, I had escape once because I overstayed my schedule.</p>

<p>And for some reason there is freedom across running away. Some fluidity as I run between the blue lit upper floors and the school baroque brown wood walls, and in conjunction I can flow fast in between the risky jumps of the multi levels or cram myself into tiny holes to reach another building.</p>

<p>In most of my dreams in the</p>
