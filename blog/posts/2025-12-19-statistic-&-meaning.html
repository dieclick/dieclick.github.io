<h1>I will be a number. maybe soon.</h1>
<p>I for once</p>

<p>Don’t think I am</p>

<p>I think I’ve exhausted all my options honestly<br>
I’ve done all I could</p>

<p>But finally… I honestly think I don’t have a future. You know</p>

<p>I talked to you many times<br>
And many times you reached me how to react and you behave</p>

<p>But this time…<br>
Yeah</p>

<p>I admit it…</p>

<p>I don’t want to live more</p>

<p>I mean it</p>

<p>It’s a fight I’m not winning</p>

<p>And there’s nobody to help me.</p>

<p>There is no one in the past and no one in the future.</p>

<p>I don’t…… have any worth</p>

<p>And I’m a coward… because I didn’t want to admit it…</p>

<p>But I’ll do it now.. I can’t keep going.</p>

<p>I reached the point of no return.</p>

<p>I reached the bottomless of my loneliness<br>
The pit of my worthless.</p>

<p>Look everywhere else. They can smile happily. I can’t. I can’t even tell anyone that I can’t smile.</p>

<p>The truth is that I’m an extra in this world…</p>

<p>And so what gives if I can’t give myself the benefit of a deep slumber to soothe my pain.</p>

<p>I thought I was strong or delirious enough to think I’m immune to suicide.<br>
But I’m not…</p>

<p>I’m like all those people who had their reasons. And I didn’t had them earlier… but I found mine.</p>
