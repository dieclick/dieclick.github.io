<h1>I think I woke up</h1>
<p>I swear I think I have woken up, i was sleeping, and in the nightmare, I saw her. I initially slept because I felt tired, but time after I couldn't sleep really.
but after sometime I was in the dream being tortured by the flames in what seemed too be my house, and I saw everyone, they all judged me, as I did the atrocious, she was there. For some reason. it's been a minute and thirty seconds, time flies by. I know, I couldn't do anything, I just kept talking to her, as I saw her standing, I told her that I needed to say something
but I couldn't. I couldn't know why she kept torturing me, haunting me by her pressence, why o why was I guilty of the pityness of her actions
I couldn't breathe it. Following me around. I knew I couldn't be the one, I knew I know what is beyond the veil but I can't do it. I can't go out and reach my hand through the razorwire just for the chance of her snapping back to a reality she might've never even been there.
So i took the deep breath she kept at close distance, right bside me, she looked me at the eyes, and knew.... knew that I was guilty. So why did she ask, why did you share the burden overflowing with disgrace. And as fire in pillars lighted behind her, I knew. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
IT WAS NOT MY FAULT AND I WILL NEVER BE, I CAN'T SAVE HER AND I WILL NOT CHANGE THAT, WHY AM I DREAMING OF TORTURE AND PAIN IF I WILL NOT CHANGE IT
THE FLAMES ENGULFED MY BODY AS I SAW THORUGH THE LIE, AS I DREAM. I WAS AWAKE BUT SHIFTING THROUGHT REALITY I HOLD MY BREATH GASPED MY AIR, AND LET OUT MY BODY TO SHAKE AND STARTLE UPON THE HEAVY MAGNET THAT PULLED ME INSIDE THE DREAM WORLD, INSIDE THE MADNESS AND BLAMES I SHIFTED WITHIN REALITY AND FICTION, THE VISIONS OF FALSEHOOD FLASH IN STRIPES AND LIGHTS BENEATH MY EYESM AS MY BODY FEELS AGAIN FEELING THE TEXTURE OF WHATS REAL
I AM NOT THERE, THAT IS NOT REAL, THE DREAM IS FAKE, THE DREAM IS SHIFTING, I AM NOT LIVING THE WAKING NIGHTMARE, AS I......... woke up.</p>
