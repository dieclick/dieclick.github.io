<h1>I know they are not horses, but I'm human, so what gives.</h1>
<p>I wake up once more... now, these days, I wake up to my PC, gladly. I continue my routine, my schedule, my task.</p>

<p>I watched a video about the game <em>Horses</em>, a very horrifying game about the cruel nature of human flaws, a game that depicts how we become a cog of the ultimate cruelness.</p>

<p>And I got to confess: I do have a game that I've been thinking about. But it is… cruel. Horrible. Disgusting.</p>

<p>I have the idea, and some notes, of a game that delves into the most depravity of the most unnatural and casual things we live in these days. And no, it's not some extreme political view or a discourse on how society collapses. Society is a liquid with many shapes and vectors. But this game…</p>

<p>I haven't shared anything about it, and I don't think I really want to. But something calls me to do it. Something so deeply and so sinister pulls me from the obsession deep within me, as a right, or as a vocal way to proclaim and to shout the horrors I know, in the only way I know to do it best.</p>

<p>This game sickens me to the deepest cells of my bones; it twitches and contorts my body in pulmonary pain. It revolts my stomach to nausea and to vomiting by writing it.</p>

<p>This project is the maximum expression of the sickness and depravity I can possible write about.</p>

<p>But I have to do it.<br>
Because no one else has done it.</p>

<p>Now, it won't be tomorrow, and probably not going to be until some years.</p>

<p>And that is EVEN if I decide to actually make it.</p>

<p>But I wake up from the bed. I eat breakfast alone. I walk upstairs to my desk. Boot up my PC. And begin to code. Or to animate. Or to write.</p>

<p>Even if no one will shine a light on it. Even if I am a single dot of information on the net, even if my message and my story are nowhere to be seen or heard by people. And yet,</p>

<p>I still do it.<br>
I still use my fingers to push down the keys of my keyboard and the button on my mouse. Even if they bleed, or they get sore, or they break.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a man more delusional on his purpose?<br>
A man shouting at walls?</p>

<p>I have.</p>

<p>I see him all the time.</p>
