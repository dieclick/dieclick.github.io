<h1>For once</h1>

<p>I feel relieved for once.<br>
After thinking anxiously for one day for less than 20 hours.</p>

<p>The anxiety or the long exposure to modern graphics distort my time extremely.<br>
Two minutes feel like ten, ten feel like 40 and an hour feels like five.<br>
A day feels like two and a week feels like 15 days.</p>

<p>But just once. For once. I made the choice to ask go peace.</p>

<p>I feel relief because in the mercy of an old friend I don’t have to risk the chance of seeing the m girl.</p>

<p>For once my needle has rotated towards quelling.</p>

<p>In this burning hot hell.</p>

<p>Is it real that healing is not measured by the distance of each breakdown but the recovery speed of each breakdown?</p>

<p>It’s not easy when you don’t know better.</p>
