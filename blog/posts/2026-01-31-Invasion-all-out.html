<h1>Diego</h1>

<p>
In the apocalypse, he has his own resource: the Lucky Man.
</p>

<p>
It’s not complex. He has a hand of cards and can play with anybody. However, he needs to guess something about the person.
</p>

<p>
If he guesses right, he gets to consume their soul.
</p>

<p>
But if his suave talk is not enough, he can try to use some of his kinetic powers, like seeing a hint of a glowing orb right behind their necks.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, using such trickery in front of others will make them harder to convince to play his card.
</p>

<p>
He goes from room to room and table to table. Invasion all out.
