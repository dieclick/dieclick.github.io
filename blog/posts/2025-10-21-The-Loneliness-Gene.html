<h1>The loneliness gene</h1>
<p>I have talked before about it. I think I need to explain what the loneliness gene is. I think it is an aspect of undeniable mistake in our
systems. It is a mistake deep engrained in within our brains.
I see what all of us call success. The luxury, the power, but in truth most of what people like to pretend they want the most is usually
the combination of a peaceful life and stability. We come in this society directed by our dynamics to chase something. Nothing new really.
But I am beggining to get worried that this objectively form of success is unatainable for some of us. In one aspect it might be the
frustrating shape of our thoughts lingering us with a carrot tied to a stick. That carrot we chase is our idea of success. The success comes
from our desires, our deepest, most envious desires. No one really wants a peaceful and stable life. Some do, really. But most people, at least
in some form, have that. Not the stability part, but the idea they have upfront of the ideal life they must choose.
What I'm trying to get at is for us broken ones. We have no choice but to feel miserable in the constant everlasting search for succes
and dissapointment, But just how much is it true?

Editors Note- I just took a massive shit so I lost track and inspiration. I will continue someday with part 2. Cheers</p>
