<h1>Pill</h1>
<p>I don’t like the pills</p>
<p>I don’t feel better</p>
<p>I know it’s one day but I already feel like shit</p>
<p>And uneasy experience in my body runs deep in my veins</p>
<p>I don’t feel relaxed I feel even more anxious after taking the anxious pill</p>
<p>I feel tired but I don’t sleep better.</p>
<p>I think the sleep pill worked.</p>
<p>But now I slept a bit little.</p>
<p>Am I destroying my body?</p>
<p>Are the psychologist and psychiatrist destroying my body?</p>
<p>I have hunger.</p>
<p>Intolerable hunger.</p>
<p>Will I get fat?</p>
<p>Will grow rashes? Or pimples in my skin?</p>
<p>I can’t concentrate, I can’t finish my game. And it’s there! It’s right there just a couple of steps to finish it.</p>
<p>She hid the side effects for the tiny little dose of a tablet.</p>
<p>Am I nuking it?</p>
<p>I look back. I was soo good. I was soo stable. But each month I’m deepening, I’m going down and down and down.</p>
<p>I will eventually loose my youth, loose my skills. Loose myself.</p>
<p>I don’t trust them. I really don’t.</p>
<p>Every time I yawn, for some reason my lymph nodes deactivate. They produce an inflammatory sensation, for a second I asphyxiate.</p>
<p>And the hunger</p>
<p>The intolerable hunger.</p>
<p>My stomach brawls and growls</p>
<p>I need to fight the hunger</p>
<p>I need to control myself</p>
<p>I need to fight myself</p>
<p>My anxiety isn’t chronic. Is it?</p>
<p>My depression isn’t chronic. Is it?</p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p>She asks how do I feel</p>
<p>Fuck do I know</p>
<p>I can’t tell you</p>
<p>If nobody thought you the word fear, how would you describe it?</p>
