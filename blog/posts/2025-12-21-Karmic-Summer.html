<h1>Rabid dog</h1>

<p>Why can’t I be a summer?<br>
A lucky contest and in the death game of life? A privilege soul. Why do I care, making me lose?</p>

<p>The one that cares always loses.</p>

<p>How little can you care? If one were given the ability to empathise would it be an advantage or disadvantage?</p>

<p>A weakness a robot can’t have is to be influenced by guilt or emotions. Now summer got what she wanted and didn’t had to pay. Because this universe does not leave in karmic retribution.</p>

<p>But if the f girl wrongs me. If a shitty empathless person wrongs and destroy a soul after devouring it gets to keep ongoing, each one other interaction randomly colliding like lost asteroids don’t guarantee any lesson or justice. Even children know that. Bullies grow, and some of them never get repercussions, some don’t get an avalanche of bad decisions, they just… change, and for better. Some are shitty. And get lucky, keep wronging and never facing but others just become better, or inoffensive at best.</p>

<p>Do you know why killers get no mercy?<br>
Do you know what happened to the murderer A of Junko?</p>

<p>He’s an old man rotting and depressed, consumed by maga and filled bitterness. He claims he regrets what he did to Junko… but, that really doesn’t matter. Proving it or not, a weeping dog is not better than the other dog if both bite.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be even fun to kill him, there wouldn’t be any reward, there wouldn’t be any medieval angst released or emotions blowing up by killing in the name of justice a rapist and murderer.<br>
It’s a sick old dog now.<br>
It’s not the villainous yakuza danger boy now. It’s a sickening man with a twisted past and a meaningless present.</p>

<p>Summer could have had a new experience that showed her how her avoidance and her lack of empathy would eat her back…. But so is the chance that she never confronts that. She has the summer effect after all.<br>
Why change if most men will fall for her regardless?</p>

<p>Why change if you’re not broken?</p>

<p>A predator doesn’t feel remorse, but it also doesn’t feel depth.</p>

<p>Is a deal I would have chosen.</p>
