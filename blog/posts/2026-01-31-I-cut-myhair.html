<p>THE F GIRL</p>
<p>I THINK OF HER</p>
<p>IM FUCKED</p>
<p>IVE WORKING TO CRAWL MY SPACE BUT SHE INVADES ME</p>
<p>and nothing has happened.</p>
<p>i just took a shower</p>
<p>why is the end of the world?</p>
<p>WHY DO I LOOK THE SAME AS BEFORE</p>
<p>THE SHITTY HAIRCUT THAT HALVES LIKE O HARE</p>
<p>I HATE IT</p>
<p>I CANT LOOK AT THE MIRROR AGAIN</p>
<p>I USED TO HAVE THE LONG HAIR AND I WAS SMILING THERE</p>

<p>CANT YOU SEE THE DREAMS YOU HAVE?</p>
<p>SHE DIDNT CROSS YOU MIND</p>
<p>AND YOU SLOWLY DWELVE INTO HER</p>
<p>SLOWLY BUT SURELY YOU FALL BEWITCHED INTO HER STIMULUS</p>
<p>YOU SHAKE AND DISCONTROL BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN SENSE THE FORCE BY WICH YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER</p>
<p>THE RESPONSABILITY</p>
<p>THE AUTHORITY</p>
<p>THE SON</p>
<p>YOU ARE BECOMING LIKE THE MAN THAT STARTED THIS BLOG</p>
<p>THE WEAK BROKEN CHILDLESS FAGGOT THAT CRY TO SLEEP AND WAKES UP THINKING OF HER</p>
<p>YOU DON'T EVEN THINK OF HER YOU ONLY SEE HER REFLECTION OF YOUR RETINAS</p>
<p>THE F GIRL IS NOT A PERSON</p>

<p>BUT THIS THOUGHT IS NOT OVER</p>
