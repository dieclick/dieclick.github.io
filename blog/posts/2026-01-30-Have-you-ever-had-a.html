<h1>Just when i tought SIKE</h1>
<p>not taking the pills anymore said no, the therapist is not trusty, she looked at me, in her eyes i can see deception i can she doesnt give ashit about me, shes a miserable result of a human, i can see it in her tired and saggy eyes, as she is not where she wanted, or maybe she did or me she didnt or maybe its her daughter, but nonetheless i can see trhough her words, i know she didnt want me to take the meds, beacues she likes the profit, she likes to charge extra smooth for her knowledge but i know she didnt pay attention to me until i said i was stopping the drugs and now she tried to stop me but i wont and iwont take more drugs, and you know what its funny very fynny very very funny because the drungs werent what they told because she didnt even told me what they were, she didnt want me to know what they were, they never letted me see them because she didnt let me know what they were and guess fucking what the sleep pill wasnt sleep pill it was a FUCKING ANTISPYCHOTIC BUT BOO HOO BITCH</p>

<p>How can you trust the doctor if the doctor needs you sick for him to be healthy, was it true in ancient chine you pay them when you were healthy. now these doctors can make you suffer for no lesson and no moral earned and they dont give a shit about you and its important they dont give a shit about you because you are spendable and you can die and they are taught very much that they cant care about you and if they care about you they need to stop, because its all fucked up.</p>

<p>why would she help if shes not obliged, but so convinient that i see a doctor and his wife is a theraphist and i just conviniently need a therapist and not heart transplant, and how convenient i dont need therapy but i need drugs but not only drugs i need psychiatrist and she just convientenly has a friend that is transplant. what thefuck are they gonna do to me? are they goona heal me'? they need my money to survive they need me sick, are they gonna love? heal all my pain? heed me? i can see in the eyes the malevolence</p>

<p>i need to stop thinking in her in her and the idea of her, and who is her, and what she is as she is not anybody and the idea is the dim light that smiles at me in my dreams DO YOU HAVE ANY REMOTE IDEA OF HOW BAD THINGS ARE??????</p>

<p>IN NO HORIZON DO I SEE THE FINISH LINE.</p>

<p>im fucked</p>

<p>im fucked sofucked</p>

<p>i thought i was the chill dog, fuck now not me now not now.</p>

<p>I was building something I THOUGHT, but why is the sea tracking me and pulling me down, do they want to drown me????</p>

<p>how insightful<br>
how poetic</p>

<p>you are not than a man that rambles and jokes so much and so mixed you cant even distiguish your feelings from inside and afar.</p>

<p>is the karmic retribution burning me with the punishing weight of thousand suns?<br>
is it that?</p>

<p>Do i deserve to be chained in the misery of drama and fluctuating feelings?</p>

<p>Are your sentiments and feelings any worth if they cease form and malfucntion within waves and shapes all ever changing every hour every second?</p>

<p>Is it paranoia?</p>

<p>the agents of the past will track you down, as they are the skeletons that pull you down the pit of hell.</p>

<p>we are all a comaderie of souls trapped in eternal suffering and you can never clock out.</p>
