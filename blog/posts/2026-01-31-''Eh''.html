<h1>Foca Gato</h1>
<p>is the universe testing me<br>
is the universe checking whether im his plaything<br>
is it laughing at me<br>
is it playing me</p>

<p>fool me once<br>
now fool me twice<br>
and fool me as many times as you want<br>
as much as you feel like</p>

<p>test me<br>
brutalize me<br>
destroy me</p>

<p>is this test<br>
this test<br>
to see<br>
wether i have learned my lesson<br>
have i learned my discipline<br>
have i changed</p>

<p>for a year<br>
pain and suffering have had the most protagonism in my life<br>
and i am tired</p>

<p>i am tired that even the m girl comes<br>
and shes is<br>
maybe closer than the f girl to become real<br>
the m gril stands for mutilation</p>

<p>but how could i blame the universe if it is i who have tainted my own hands</p>

<p>i want to abandon the past<br>
i truly want to set it back<br>
but it keeps reaching<br>
it keeps returning and grabing me from the dark cloud</p>

<p>and how can i blame them, they are people<br>
they have feelings<br>
they want to reach out to me.</p>

<p>I can't torture them!<br>
I can't play with them!<br>
but i can't set them out!</p>

<p>I AM A CHANGED MAN<br>
are you<br>
jijijiji</p>

<p>you are nothing but a laughing stock<br>
you will check that message<br>
you will check that mail<br>
you will see that status<br>
you will await that reply<br>
you will be anxious<br>
you will pry your nails open as you did<br>
you will return to your haircut<br>
you will return to your uglyness<br>
you will return to hell</p>

<p>no man changes</p>

<p>accept yourself</p>

<p>let love (or its lack of)<br>
destroy you.</p>

<p>Nothing is real regardless of your grievious wounds.</p>
