<h1>Should I get a publisher?</h1>
<p>Dang... I've had this question for quite a while now, not sure if I should contact a publisher for bodekai train.... I suppose this
game has escaped its scope of beign a small game... a pretty much just a recreation of another game topdown with powers.
I planned on selling for 3 dollars, man... the best games are just there for 20 bucks, hell no. my game can't reach that ... quality?
I just... know, that something is missing. something just keeps my game from looking... polished, or professional. like you just
know, this is not the real deal man.</p>
