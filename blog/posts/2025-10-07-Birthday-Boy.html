<h1>Birth day is coming up</h1>
<p>Part of me remembers things long ago, and sometimes I remember nothing. Kept thinking about, all... my choices. I do take pride
in taking wrong choices, since... at least they are my fault and were done by myself.
But Now... One year after, close to many.
  Every birthday I repeat the same mistakes.
Or maybe not mistakes, but I do make the same things over and over. Every birthday I dedicate a drawing to myself.
Now, I will do the same thing to celebrate as I did last year.
Last year was the only time I could really say I got happy.
It was an escape room, themed as saw. My god, was I thrilled.
Now... I will do it again.
Just now that the things are so... so much different. We were going so many people, it even got to the point were we had to reserve two separate rooms.
Now.. we don't even fill one.
A year ago, I had a girlfriend. I had more friends. Although, to be honest.
The friends were...
It's complicated. Said friends did many things. Some hurt, more than others.
The girlfriend...
She... It's even more complicated. The whole deal was complicated.
I see at first glance how little I am now, but... How much more little I was before?
How does one really sees growth? Who measures it?
I suppose it just is a question I keep for myself... Dear dairy. (￣y▽,￣)╭ 

  I do wonder how much time I keep going on this blog until I doxx myself or some stupid shit. I might share too much here... and for now I do not care.
  I guess my enemies could use this blogs to analyse me... if any enemy is interested in me that is.

It's just... so easy to not be see, and so hard to keep any eyes looking on you.
It's my personal blog, I get to rant about so, shut it.
