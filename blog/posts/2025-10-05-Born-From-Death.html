<h1>I fear death</h1>
<p>I was planning on making a blog... maybe, before I die. I don't have plans to die, obviously.. but this blog sparked from a need to write off this important feeling. This was born from death, death of my aunt, she still doesn't die. But she is close. Maybe next week she will die. Old, sick, fragile.
I know... I sound inhumane, or... simply unrelated to her. But that is far from true, I was with her since young. And it's odd, I don't talk about her. But I have a story.
Before studying a simple digital desing college career I was bound to study bionanotechnology. That was a key move.
Before all of this part, my days were so similar, all of them, so.... tiring. So... same, boring, uninspired.
Some part of me was trained on "greatness" or... a constant intent on being up. Since the slogan of a school I went for more than around a decade.
In the begining. I didn't have anything to prove. No pressure or no... desire. no path, no life, no friends. Had some... but I still felt alone. In this empty black void space. Inside it, I was deep alone with my thoughts.
I suppose that inside that little head of a 8 years old boy, the most terrible and fearful thing that could happen was death. It was my most profound fear of inimaginable understanding.
Just the bare concept of unexistance. It send cold waves on my skin, and it kept me trying thinking about it, like a puzzle with solution.
My aunt... the sweetest woman ever. she lived alone, that scared me. I was a very ... "scareable?" child. Whenever I had to go to her house I was not mad completely.
Out of everyone, setting expectations, laughing at me... talking about me like and object. She... was genuine, in a way that not even my parents were, she wasl talking about a spark.
A little shine of light and hope inside me that she saw when everyone else didn't. She told me that she knew I was bound to do something big. Something... meaningful. I can remember how only she got close to my ear to tell me...
I believe in you. I know you'll do.
She always believed in me...
But in what?
what greatness?
An emperor? A salary man? A philanthropist?
What kind of man should I have to become?
I just didn't knew what she meant. For me what was to be successful? Me... A child that yearns every day to only hop on his console and play videogames, a child that day dreams alone.
I truly felt alone all those years. But also unmoving, purposeless. what... what greatness. why did she had to repeat me how smart I was, why only her, why did she said it. Why?
As I grew that question kept with me, with the more complex understanding from what is death, and passing. I just saw I had no real path upon my feet to see.
Until.... I saw something that caught my attention. I don't remember what sparked it initially... But something I was investigating resonated a lot. It was talks about something impossible.
The end of aging.
Now I don't know what I used to think at that point, but everything was slowly making sense just as I opened my path towards this wonder of a microscopic world.
The thesis was simple, at that time I only used to know about one function of the cells. Apoptosis. The cells death, or rather. suicide. To avoid becoming a cancer cell.
The interesting part was when I discovered the function of telomerase. The may called tap of telomere, A crucial identifying part in the adn. The thing is, that as aging occurs, we stop producing telomerase, so the tap that protects our dna weakens, causing our DNA to get corrupted, and prompting apoptosis.
At the time I thought, well... If we stop producing it, why don't we keep intaking the protein to avoid genes degradation?
  THAT, that was it.
That flashing thought hooked me. That was something I just kept myself wondering, how? How? How is it possible that nobody is watching this? Is this some forbiden knowledge
But most importantly... That thing... I got it. That was it.
If she meant anything about me, it was because I was going to beat the impossible. This was the spark. this was the greatness. The terrible fear I had about death, clicked in.
If I was bound, it was to avoid death.
I was set to find the aging solution. It was real, it was not just some science fiction. I could see it, grasp it. Understand it.
When I was in 7th grade I decided that I was going to pursue knowledge in biotechnology. A researcher.
At the time, I saw my aunt. I had nothing but empathy and love for her. Every time she hosted parties, I just thought. Well, shes gonna sleep alone tonight. I was scared of the darkness.
I wouldn't want to sleep alone on a dark house. I saw her.... loneliness...
The loneliness gene.
So... I invited her every single time. Come to sleep with us. Don't be alone. I just... saw that in her heart she didn't deserve a lonely night. She was so sweet. she was so..... pure.
In every man's heart there is darkness. And in all of us, we have sin... We have punishment. But every so often a soul so pure and clear borns. She was one of those very few ones.
