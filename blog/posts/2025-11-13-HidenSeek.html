<h1>Huhg.. i dreamt a game</h1>
<p>My dream was about playing hide and seek, but it was multiplayer. So you need to spawn and solve puzzles on your "scene" and one player will later
spawn and try to catch you, or kill you i dunno. it is something odd... obviously in this game some fuck ass player will find a way to stall the game by camping a piece or clue of the puzzle
yeah,,,, some ideas are just meant to die asleep.</p>
