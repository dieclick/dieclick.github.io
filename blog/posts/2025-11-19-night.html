<p>Whenever this happens I just want to already be in Canada. To let the frozen winds take up my mind and push deep the pain and suffering.</p>
<p>The dependency and misery floating above it all infests my dreams and only so if they let me dream. As they are the demonic tortures of my heart that keep me awake at late nights, sometimes even when I see the sun rise once more.</p>
<p>It suffers, the pain, the loss, the hatred, and the everlasting sorrow of regret and remembering.</p>
<p>Do you think? Do you think you can be strong as a superman? As a fictional character designed to upfront all.</p>
<p>Well I found out I can’t. I simply can’t. I’m not strong enough, I’m not smart enough, maybe just enough to see my suffering.</p>
<p>And unlike superman. I have nightmares.</p>
