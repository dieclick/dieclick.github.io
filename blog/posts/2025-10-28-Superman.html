<h1>Super man</h1>
<p>You know right? the big manly superhero that saves everyone with a heart of gold, an absolute unbreakable spirit.
Since early I fucking hated superman, For real... I mean, i hated even his name. He was to me the most basic and boringly bland
character a hero could be. At least batman has a detective twist right? Captain America was a propaganda machine that made its own
identity, and ironman was a man machine cross that allowed us to imagine our easier lives if we each had our own jarvis... thing we kinda have now.

But superman?
Fucking superman has nothing special. He is the most generic definition of a superheroe. His powers consist not of intellect or self made tools.
But instead his own simple yet broken powers. He fights? well he punches hard, he gets shot? nuh uh, he is bullet proof. The enemy is on the fucking air? Well guess what he can also do then.

Part of me always hated his simplicity. His simply unbrokable spirit, or his undefeatable powers.
But in truth I barely read comics. The first time I actually sat down to enjoy a comic was with manga. It was like highschool in which
a girl of my class talked to me about selling me some anime and stuff crate. Not that I talked much to her, but okay fine, the idea of a mystery anime themed thrilled me a bit. Maybe the mordib curiosity of what I could find.
The crate had some 2000's anime magazines and some mangas, like card captor or reservoir chronicles, teenager me, was not that dissapointed when a full frontal poster of lewd girls appeared on the magazines, crazy to post that in magazine with children and teens.
Now saying that I had manga earlier than comics does not help my case at attacking superman for not being deep. if anything, anime is way worse for
using bland and two dimensional characters.
After some time, I dwelved into watchmen, and I liked it... A bit... I certainly didn't like how I had to buy like 4 extra comics to read doomsday clock. AND IN SOME OF THEM ONLY THE FUCKING PIN APPEARS.
I did like doomsday a bit, not because it had any relevance to watchmen, if anything its pretty shit compared to it. But I did enjoy reading the full thing much more than the fucking extra comics with just one teaser at the of them.
In fact when the fight of superman vs dr.manhattan came up. I was expecting superman to just blow him up one punch man style.. but...
No?... Superman just fakes the punch for no reason, he doesnt kill manhattan even after all the setup to make him do it. he... he just fucking doesnt.
And while reading I just thought, what the fuck? Even manhattan was surprised for him to do that. This was the even the whole comic and EVEN THE FUCKING EXTRA COMICS were leading to.

So why?
 Whye the fuck did he not do it.

Aside from the many complaints every work continuating moore's has. This just felt odd. and I kept it in the back of my head for a time.
From time to time, I used to percieve how they turn superman into this evil twisted version of him in the edgy 2000's. But nowadays his image was a bit restaurated
with his show and his movie. Now... I have NOT watched any of them... And I don't want much. See, the "idea" of superman began to grow on me.
Superman is simple, stupidly simple. He is simply, the better man, on everything. Always, hes the bigger person on the room.
Like a machine coded to always follow just one action. He is coded to always be a better man, not matter the circunstances.
And that... is inspiring. In the sense that... he will always be good.
Always. A conforting certainty that he will always choose the moral good. I sometimes think of myself when in doubt. what would superman do in this situation?
I mean, it is silly, but ain't it the opposite silly? Rancor, envy, or tiredness. We often do silly things too.
And I know I sound like a child, but sometimes simplest things tend to be the most effective.
When faced by a difficult decision, you... What do you do? You've fucked it up before you know that. And the next time you face yourself with a hard choice, you are inclined to be selfish or hateful... just think, what would superman do?
Knowing that superman will always choose the greater good and wellbeing. And if you just step for one second and think, well I am not superman, but if he were to find this in a comic he would very obviously do this best thing.
You cannot deny that. If you realise what superman would do, not doing the same thing would mean you actively go against the better well being of everything.
It will always be in your best interest to be as close to superman as possible, the super man. the man of tomorrow. the man we should ought to be.

Now... that helped me sometimes in past relationships... I guess I am surprised by the outcomes, almost like if I acted out of character to me...
But what is the limit.
When the decision is far too hard to make.
Lets say superman needs to kill one guy, to save the many.
Two things happen now.
If he decides to kill an innocent, he will be directly betraying his moral code, his literal code. He can't. But in order to save him. He would let more die. That also goes against his code.
Some would say that killing one, is better for the greater good, and some will say that letting all die is better because he would not betray his code. But here is the catch.

What superman really does is to defy the nature.

He will simply not take that decision. He defies and challenges the nature, and breaks through the box.

  Anyone could take that choice right? I have taken hard choices, you have taken hard choices too. But... He is the super man. He doesn't break his code. And what makes him so great, is that he has the tools to break through.

  He doesn't accept the boolean outcome. He has the strength, the endurance, the wit and the resilience to break the dilema and stay true to his morals.
  
He is short of time? he speeds up. He is beaten up hard? He always wake up. The enemy is stronger? he calls the justice league. He is not alone. He has determination, and morals. He has build up the tools to fight everything that defies goodness.

  And so he triumps over the darkness of the ego and twisted evils.

We all ought to be superman, as he is the man of tomorrow, and the man you should always try to be.</p>
