<h1>Buggy</h1>
<p>I think I have found out a new species? Maybe. I mean, every day going out to the gym i found some spider looking buddy, well each day i walked i found them crossing the road.
Well taking photos of it, and some research, a friend with me found out, that right. It's an arachnid indeed. but it's not a spider.
Looks like opiliones, a harvestmen kind of arachnid. They look completely amoled, but has a very similar size to spider, they walked funny
not scared of me, and apparently its weird to find their exact size and the same color. So rare in fact, that I just couldn't find any picture
not even a name of this exact specie, the closes example I could find is the Ischyropsalididae. But it shouldn't have that shape in the back
it actually is just softly rounded, although it does have a bit of a texture, a bit glossy.</p>
<p>So, maybe... I just found a new type of bug...§(*￣▽￣*)§.... maybe... just maybe though.</p>
