<h1>Happy new year lieutenant Dan</h1>

<p>It’s a wonderful moment, for everybody, as some go to eccentric parties with booze wine, and some have dinner with their families and some like me. Spend the last day… thinking. Lonely.</p>

<p>I cot a sickness a week ago. It’s mind numbingly tired some, I’m coughing blood from all the coughing I made. My ears are so inflated they don’t even let me hear my own voice clearly, my nose is always half closed and the other side is leaking mucous.</p>

<p>And I hear the faint laughs and speeches people at the other side of the house have. But me, alone in a room. Not even as comfortable as my bedroom.</p>

<p>I remember what I lost most, how was I…. Having a time. How I still had her, how I had myself… and in a couple of days the anniversary of my happiest days will come… and I, will remember how alone I can be. As a dreamer. As a drug addict.</p>

<p>In one year, I… took so many wrong options. And now… I’ve come back to square one.</p>

<p>No one professes love for me, and I don’t profess love to any. And I’m seek, and my body hurts, and my soul is darken. I broke. And I have not healed, I have not forgotten her, but I did forgot myself.</p>

<p>It’s funny now, how I’ve rewinded my life, I visited places I did 10 years ago, I even got as sick as I was 10 years ago, I behaved exactly how I did 10 years ago.</p>

<p>And now I’m tired, I’m used, sick, and tired. Maybe I was happy.</p>

<p>Maybe I was not.</p>

<p>But… damn…. I want to be there again.</p>

<p>If you ever doubt you can go low, here be evidence. Evidence of a man that doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
