<h1>You, invader zim</h1>
<p>
Why do you hijack my dreams?
</p>

<p>
Why do you hijack my dreams where you are with me? And it’s not you, I know it’s not you.
</p>

<p>
It’s the idea, not the person.
</p>

<p>
Why do you accompany me at the end of times?
</p>

<p>
Why do you stay with me in my grandpa house?
</p>

<p>
Why are you invading my thoughts if I know you are poison to my throat?
</p>

<p>
I know you bleed me, but I still crave you.
</p>

<p>
Oh but it’s not you. Not you you.
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t you when you stepped out of the shower in my dream. Nor was it you when you sat right next to me at the family dinner.
</p>

<p>
It was the f girl.
</p>

<p>
Not you.
</p>

<p>
You just woke up.
</p>

<p>
Desiring something else.
</p>

<p>
But the f girl.
</p>

<p>
She’s my plaything.
</p>

<p>
A spiking, painful plaything.
</p>
