<h1>Mirror</h1>
<p>I get saddened just by looking at my photos</p>

<p>A strange longing for my own reflection, a guy who killed himself with the pictures of his friends family and lovers in the gallery of his phone. I miss myself somehow</p>

<p>Is this something that happens when you decide it?<br>
You you finally decide it?<br>
Am I… already making the preparations?</p>

<p>In a smooth swift of movements and words.</p>

<p>I don’t feel sadness I feel emptiness. Tiredness.</p>

<p>I am depleted. Completely.<br>
This model of existence will kill me<br>
Chemically. Slowly.</p>

<p>I will die regardless, why don’t I just ease and save myself the suffering?</p>

<p>I was once judged and held by others. I was suffering because others… they could’ve saved me the pain. The suffering.<br>
But both decided instead to… play. With me.</p>

<p>Why? Why would the do that?<br>
Why would they talk to me, to hid me, to deflect that they have chosen outside of me.<br>
Why? do I need to find out by myself? Why does it always rely on me?</p>

<p>I’ve carried it, carried the dynamics.</p>

<p>And it won’t change. Ever.</p>

<p>Friends won’t change, lovers won’t change, family won’t change.</p>

<p>Now the reason is not that nobody is willing to help you. A misunderstanding of what to feel alone is about.</p>

<p>Sure, there might be one or two that would like to help.</p>

<p>But loneliness comes from the time you find out… no one works.</p>

<p>Help is useless<br>
Intent is useless</p>

<p>At the end of the night when the sun arises you look at yourself rotten.</p>

<p>All those faces who wanted to support you have failed you that very moment the sun shows.</p>

<p>That’s when you know it’s far gone.</p>

<p>Unlike other who come out and blissfully live.</p>

<p>Not you.</p>

<p>You are not meant to recover.</p>

<p>You are meant to suffer.</p>

<p>And I can’t suffer no more.</p>

<p>I have been broken.</p>

<p>I have looked the mirror. And just for glimpses I saw my face<br>
But my real face.</p>

<p>My deep dark face within that everyone has but not everyone sees.<br>
A face you need years to spend time with to trust and understand. Once you see it you can’t unsee it. It’s an effect that happens a lot with familiars.</p>

<p>But in the mirror, I don’t see that face of me…. My eyes, my hair, my nose.<br>
All of them have reconstructed a mask. A person of other.</p>

<p>And just for glimpses I saw him. Me. again still trapped beneath.</p>

<p>I’m not even myself in this desolate dark spiralling torture I endure.</p>

<p>I can’t be in misery, as I can’t be in happiness. As I can’t exist anywhere.</p>
